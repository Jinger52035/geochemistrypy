GeochemistryPy is **a Python framework** for data-driven geochemistry discovery. It provides an extendable tool and
one-stop shop for **geochemical data analysis**.

The goal of the Geochemistry Py is to create user-friendly and extensible products of high automation for the full cycle
of geochemistry research, including a **python package** and a **software** with a command-line interface in the first stage.

The activity diagram of the Geochemistry Py Version 1.0.0:

The whole package is under construction and the documentation is progressively evolving.

## Join Us :)
**The recruitment of research interns is ongoing !!!**

**All things are done online...**

**What can you learn?**
+ Learning the full cycle of data mining on geochemistry data, including the algorithms in regression,
classification, clustering, and decomposition.
+ Learning to be a qualified Python developer, including any Python programing contents towards data mining,
basic software engineering techniques and tools like Git.

**What can you get?**  

+ Scientific research internship certificate and a recommendation letter.
+ Chance to pay a visit to Hangzhou, China, sponsored by ZJU Earth Data.
+ Some bonus depending on your performance. 

**Current Working Pattern:**
+ Online working and cooperation
+ Two weeks per working cycle -> One online meeting per working cycle

Even if you are not familiar with topics above, but if you are interested in and have plenty of time to do it.
That's enough. We have a full-developed training system to help you, as a newbie of data mining or Python developer,
learn steps by steps with seniors until you can make a significant contribution to our project.
